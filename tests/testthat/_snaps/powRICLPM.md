# Ã  priori power analysis using powRICLPM() runs

    
    A priori powRICLPM-analysis completed:
     - Monte Carlo replications:  30
     - Target power:  0.8
     - Preliminary recommended sample size: NOT FOUND
    
    Sugested next steps:
     - Increase search_upper and rerun the analysis.
     - Use powRICLPM_plot() to visualize preliminary results for entire range of sample sizes.

    A priori powRICLPM-analysis completed:
     - Monte Carlo replications:  100
     - Target power:  0.8
     - Preliminary recommended sample size:  450
     - Number of non-converged replications for recommended run:  0
     - Number of replications with inadmissible estimates for recommended run:  0
    
    Sugested next steps:
     - Use powRICLPM_plot() to visualize preliminary results for entire range of sample sizes.
     - Rerun powRICLPM with the recommended sample size and large number of replications to validate preliminary results.
