# sample size recommendation using powRICLPM() works

    
    powRICLPM analysis completed:
     - Monte Carlo replications:  5
     - Sample size(s): 50 100
     - Number of time points: 3
     - Proportion(s) random intercept variance: 0.5
     - Target power: 0.8
    
    Number of conditions that reach target power: 0
    
    Suggested next steps:
     - Increase search_upper and rerun the analysis.
     - Use `plot_powRICLPM()` to visualize results across all experimental conditions.

     - Sample size(s): 400 500
     - Number of time points: 3 4
     - Proportion(s) random intercept variance: 0.3 0.7
     - Target power: 0.8
    
    Number of conditions that reach target power: 5
    
    Suggested next steps:
     - If this is a preliminary powRICLPM analysis, validate these recommendations (or a selection) by rerunning the analysis with an increased number of replications (e.g., `reps = 1000`).
     - Use `plot_powRICLPM()` to visualize results across all experimental conditions.
