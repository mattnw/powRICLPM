TITLE:      
    Test of Monte Carlo power analysis using powRICLPM
    Sample size - 300
    Number of waves - 3
    ICC - 0.3

DATA:
	FILE = dfList.dat;
	TYPE = MONTECARLO;
	
VARIABLE:
    NAMES = x1-x3 y1-y3;

ANALYSIS:   
    MODEL = NOCOV; ! Sets all default covariances to zero

MODEL:
    ! Create between-components (random intercepts)
    RI_x BY x1@1 x2@1 x3@1;
    RI_y BY y1@1 y2@1 y3@1;

    ! Estimate variances of random intercepts
    RI_x*1 RI_y*1;

    ! Estimate the covariance between the random intercepts
    RI_x WITH RI_y*0.3;

    ! Create within-person centered variables
    wx1 BY x1@1; 
    wx2 BY x2@1;
    wx3 BY x3@1; 
              
    wy1 BY y1@1; 
    wy2 BY y2@1;
    wy3 BY y3@1; 

    ! Constrain the measurement error variances to zero
    x1-y3@0;

    ! Estimate the lagged effects between the within-person centered variables
    wx2 ON wx1*0.4 wy1*0.15;
    wy2 ON wx1*0.2 wy1*0.3;
    
    wx3 ON wx2*0.4 wy2*0.15;
    wy3 ON wx2*0.2 wy2*0.3;

    ! Estimate the (residual) variances.
    wx1*1 wy1*1; 
    wx2*0.7815 wy2*0.834;
    wx3*0.7815 wy3*0.834;

    ! Estimate the covariance between the within-person
    ! components at the first wave
    wx1 WITH wy1*0.3;

    ! Estimate the covariances between the residuals of
    ! the within-person components (the innovations)
    wx2 WITH wy2*0.13;
    wx3 WITH wy3*0.13;
